                In order to learn best practices for designing responsive interfaces, I explored the website of a beloved institution from my hometown Oscar's Burritos.
                After finding some areas of improvement in the original site, I set out to redesign the frontend of the site to be more responsive and accessible to different 
                viewers. I also aimed to reduce the extraneous details to make it easier to find the information that is most important to customers.

            <p>I started by conducting an evaluation of Oscar's Burritos current website. Through personal evaluation and through the use of WAVE, I noticed five issues I wanted to tackle.</p>
            <hr class="list-divider">
            <ol>
                <li>Website elements do not grow and shrink as the size of the screen changes. <b>This serves as an issue for different browser sizes and different viewing forms like phone or tablet.</b></li>
                <li>Important information like hours, address, phone number, and menu are all dispersed throughout the page. <b>As a user, I do not have an efficient path to my goal.</b></li>
                <li>There is minor redundancy throughout the home page regarding links and text. <b>The memorability of how to navigate through this website is low.</b></li>
                <li>Chosen fonts against the background are not easily readable. <b>Visually impaired readers may struggle to read vital information.</b></li>
                <li>Using an image as a header reduces accessibility. <b>Those who need to use a screen reader may not be able to understand the purpose of this website.</b></li>
            </ol>

            <p>To start my redesign, I conducted a speed sketch of nine possible ideas that I may choose to use when creating the website. I spent one minute on each idea just to get my creative intuition flowing.</p>
            <img src="images/speedsketch.jpeg" alt="nine speed sketches"/>
            <p>After this, I created one sketch combining my favorite ideas.</p>

            <p>Using my sketch, I created three low-fidelity wireframes, one each of mobile, tablet, and desktop viewing.</p>
            <p>In the low-fidelity wireframe, I aimed to address a few of the issues noticed before.</p>
            <hr class="list-divider">
            <ul>
                <li><b>1.</b> Different website configurations based on the size of the screen improve mobile and tablet accessibility.</li>
                <li><b>2.</b> Important information is organized linearly throughout the page and in clear sections. Buttons are made very apparent.</li>
                <li><b>5.</b> The header introduces a user to the purpose of the website in a screen readable format.</li>

            <p>
                Using my low-fidelity wireframes, I created three high-fidelity wireframes, incorporating color, replacing placeholder text, and adding images. 
            </p>
            <p>The high-fidelity wireframes address the two remaining areas of improvement from the original website.</p>

                <li><b>3.</b> Extraneous text is cut down on and images are organized into a gallery so they can all be found in one place.</li>
                <li><b>4.</b> Different fonts are used to convey a local personalization vital to small business success and colors are chosen to have high contrast and match other elements from the original design.</li>

            <h1 class="section-header">Responsively Redesigned Frontend</h1>
            <p>Using my mockups, I implemented a redesigned home page for Oscar's Burritos in HTML and CSS. It is designed specifically for three main browser widths: 1482px (desktop), 768px (tablet), and 375px (mobile).</p>
            <p>This addresses all accessibility concerns. The few WAVE errors mention an image without an alt tag (which it does have in the code) and poor contrast (with a color that does not exist on the screen). I was unsure how to debug those, but as far as I know, they do not actually pose issues.</p>

            <p>
                Through this case-study, I learned tools to evaluate existing web interfaces for accessibility and responsiveness. By designing and implementing a completely redesigned interface, I 
                gained more familiarity with design processess and tools like hand sketching, brainstorming, and Figma. Additionally, I also gained new programming skills in HTML and CSS!
                In a more abstract sense, this case-study allowed me confront the ways in which web design can convey the personality, care, and genuinity of local businesses. 
                I hope to continue designing and creating interfaces for institutions I want to see succeed, letting them reach more potential customers through accessible and responsive web design.
